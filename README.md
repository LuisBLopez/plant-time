# plant-time
An online time capsule application with a plant theme.

# notes
If the program displays placeholders for the plants ("Sample Rafflesia") or the friends ("AMIGO, EMAIL@email.email"), it might be because Firebase is not correctly configured. To do so, in Android Studio click Tools>Firebase>Cloud Firestore and execute the first two steps. Then, relaunch the app and wait a few seconds. If the problem persists, please contact 100383423@alumnos.uc3m.es or 100383535@alumnos.uc3m.es
